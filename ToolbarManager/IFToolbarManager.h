 The IF_ERROR_REPORTING_LEVEL macro allows you to set the level at which IFToolbarManager reports the errors from which it recovers. Setting
 IF_ERROR_REPORTING_LEVEL to 0 will allow IFToolbarManager to recover from errors silently (this is recommended for use in production
 applications to avoid logging). Setting it to 1 will alert you when IFToolbarManager encounters an error (this is highly  recommended for
 debugging issues which are difficult to test in GUI applications.

 @class IFToolbarManager
 @abstract The main manager for a selectable toolbar.
 @discussion The IFToolbarManager class manages a selectable toolbar, populating it with toolbar items and managing the views its window
 will cycle through. The manager has a 1:1 relationship with toolbars (1 toolbar per manager, and vice versa), but can have a many:1
 relationship with a delegate (several toolbar managers per delegate object, usually a larger UI controller class). The toolbar passed to
 IFToolbarManager can be created either programmatically or through Interface Builder, and if there are any items on the toolbar, they will
 be kept and added to through the pane loading system. Although the manager makes no changes to the toolbar, it is highly recommended that
 the toolbar has customization turned off, not for reasons of compatibility, but because use of selectable toolbars usually exists in
 situations where allowing users to edit the toolbar is inappropriate.
 
 IFToolbarManager tries, when possible, to automate tasks to make use as easy as possible, but offers delegate methods to enhance
 customization. IFToolbarManager rests heavily on its identifier, reusing it whenever possible. If no identifier is passed to the manager,
 it will reuse its toolbar's identifier. IFToolbarManager uses this identifier to find the .xib file containing the panes used to populate
 its toolbar. If the identifier for the toolbar is @"MainToolbar", it will search for a MainToolbar.xib file to load its panes from, unless
 the delegate offers a different one.
 
 For its delegate, IFToolbarManager employs Michael Ash's MAZeroingWeakRef to avoid messaging a dangling pointer. The license for
 MAZeroingWeakRef is included below:
